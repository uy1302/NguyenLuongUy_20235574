- What class should implement the Comparable interface? 
Class Media
- In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method be to reflect the ordering that we want? 
Implement in code that is submitted already
- Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach? 
No, the Comparable interface only allows for one natural ordering. The ordering defined in the compareTo() method becomes the default ordering for that class.
- Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
Implement the Comparator Interface: Create a comparator class that implements the Comparator<DVD> interface.
Override the compare Method: In the compare method, define the ordering rules
