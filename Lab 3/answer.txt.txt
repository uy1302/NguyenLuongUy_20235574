1.  After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
Because Java is a passing-by-value language, the method swap only swaps copies of references to jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD, but it doesn't affect the original references in the main method.
2. After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
The changeTitle method modifies the actual jungleDVD object because setTitle(title) changes the object's state directly.
